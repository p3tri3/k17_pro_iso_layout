# Keychron K17 Pro ISO keyboard layout

## Description

I recently obtained a *Keychron K17 Pro ISO* keyboard. I was a bit supprised that, at the time of writing, there was not directly avaialbe an appropriate json keymap layout profile to be used with [Via](https://usevia.app/). Of course, Keychron offers an [online service](https://launcher.keychron.com/) where equivivalent set of keymap modifications can be made without any problems but anyway I thought it would be nice to have also an alternative way to carry out modifications through Via.

I made a tiny modification to the json file related to the similar model *K17 Max ISO* [Keychron pages](https://www.keychron.com/pages/firmware-and-json-files-of-the-keychron-qmk-k-pro-and-k-max-series-keyboards) in such a way that it works for K17 Pro ISO. The most important change was the product id. I also removed two assigned button configurations related to 2.4 GHz wireless connection since this feature is not available in Pro version.
